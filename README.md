UCSD ECE/MAE 148 Fall 2024 Team 9 Submission

Delivery Robot

There are two parts of this project: GPS PATH PLANNING and OBSTACLE DETECTION
Each part has it's own readme that gives instructions on how to use.
Unfortunately, we were unable to connect the two parts together, so we will leave that up to you.

The GPS path planning uses the GNSS to determine location and heading to navigate through waypoints generated by the algorithm.
The obstacle detection uses the camera to avoid objects that come into the frame.
